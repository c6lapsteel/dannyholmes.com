        <p>To all of our members,</p>
        <h2>Committee Update</h2>

        <p>We hope you are all well and managing to keep active during the lockdown.</p>
        <p>Due to the pandemic we have been unable to meet as normal and our social activities have been cancelled for the foreseeable future.  The club is unable to operate as it has done in the past.  A new way of doing things is emerging using technology and processes we didnâ€™t need to use before.  Zoom meetings, social media, etc. are now the norm for communicating with friends and family. We too have adopted this approach and had our first committee meeting using Zoom earlier this week.</p>

        <p>As the UK gradually eases out of lockdown we are thinking of our members and are trying to find the most appropriate way of communicating and socialising as this pandemic is progressing.  Watch this space!</p>


        <h2>Ride-outs and Observing</h2>

        <p><a href="https://www.iamroadsmart.com/media-and-policy/newsroom/news-details/2020/05/29/iam-roadsmart-motorcycle-observed-rides-resume-in-england" title="Read the full announcement from the IAM" target="_blank">Recent guidance from the IAM</a> states that:
            <ul>
                <li><em><b>observed rides</b></em> can resume from Monday 15 June in England</li>
                <li><em><b>group rides of up to six persons</b></em> can resume from Monday 01 June provided that:
                    <ul>
                        <li>they only meet outdoors</li>
                        <li>social distancing is observed at all times</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Theory work, group meetings and all face-to-face operations that do not include practical elements must still be delivered via internet video applications.</p>

        <p>Whilst this guidance is for England and Northern Ireland only, we are keeping a close eye on changes in Wales and Scotland. The guidance will be updated when the situation in those countries changes. Those in England are advised that they should <u>not</u> cross the border into Wales or Scotland.</p>

        <p>One final point: there has been negative press associated with large groups meeting at popular tourist destinations. Some local communities are actively dissuading people from visiting.  If possible, please try to avoid these locations.</p>
        <p>Wishing you all well.</p>
