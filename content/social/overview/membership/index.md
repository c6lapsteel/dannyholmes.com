### 1-2-1 Training
All members are entitled to 1-2-1 refresher rides with an Observer. You do not need to contribute towards your Observer's costs! This is one of the benefits included in your NAM subscription.

If it has been some time since you have taken your IAM Advanced Roadsmart test, or you just want a refresher ride, contact a member of the Training Team.
