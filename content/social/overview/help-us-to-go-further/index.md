The success of Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists is due the generosity of its members; riders and friends who freely give their time and exerptise to help other motorcyclists and to support club events.

Whatever your strengths, whether creative, mechanical, good at writing or good with people, get involved! Contact a member of our marketing, social or training teams to find out what they are working on and how you can help.

### EasyFundrasing
73 Members are collecting free donations everytime they shop on-line. These donations go directly towards helping us to promote motorcycle road safety.

If NAM has helped you to improve your riding skills, please consider joining EasyFundraising so that we may help other riders.

### Gift Aid
If you are a UK tax-payer, NAM could claim back £5 tax on your subsciption from HMRC. That would make your subscription worth £25 to the club.

£5 may not sound like a lot but, across the entire membership, gift aid could make a significant contribution to club funds.

### Lead a ride
Share your favourite motorcycle route with other members of the club.

For more information, contact the Rideout Coordinator.
