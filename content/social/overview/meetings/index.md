Our monthly meetings provide an opportunity to make friends, share experiences and to catch up on club news. 

During the winter months, meetings are held on the second Tuesday of the month and often feature a presentation by a guest speaker. Previous speakers have included:

- i2i Motorcycle Academy
- Great North Air Ambulance Service

Everyone is welcome at our monthly meetings. Please feel free to come along and have a look at us! Check out our [social event listing page](/event_types/social/ "Go to social event listing page") for details.

During the summer we prefer to be out on our motorbikes! Meetings take the form of evening rides, BBQs, chip shop runs, poker runs, treasure hunts, etc
