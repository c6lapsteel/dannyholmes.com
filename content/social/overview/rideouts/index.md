Our group rideouts take place on the first and third Sunday of each month throughout the 'biking season'.

All rides are considered 'Green Badge' events; the standard of riding must be commensurate with membership of NAM and the IAM. Your motorcycle must be taxed, insured and have a current MOT (if appropriate).

Category 1 rides
: Category 1 rides are aimed at riders who are still undergoing IAM Roadsmart training and who may be new to group riding. Observers will be more than happy to offer support and feedback.

: Rides are typically 100-150 miles with several refreshment stops. They provide an opportunity for members to get used to the Drop-Off System.

Category 2 rides
: Our Category 2 rides are usually 150-200 miles with fewer stops.

Riders wishing to take part must have passed their IAM Roadsmart test or have had their riding assessed by an Observer. This assessment can take place during a Category 1 Ride or one of our summer evening rides.

### Guests
Riders who do not hold an advanced riding qualification, and who are not members of the IAM, are welcome to join **one** Category 1 ride.

Advanced riders and current IAM members may join a Category 2 ride at the discretion of the Rideout Coordinator or Ride Leader.

All guests must make themselves known to the Rideout Coordinator or Ride Leader before the start of the ride.
