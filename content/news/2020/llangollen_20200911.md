Anyone fancy a long weekend in North Wales? The Social Team have made a provisional booking at the Bridge End Hotel, right in the centre of Llangollen, north Wales, from the 11th to 14th September (3 nights). 

Llangollen is a lovely small town on the river Dee with a steam train, canal, bike museum and lots of tea shops! It’s a great base from which to explore Snowdonia and the Welsh Coast.
 
The plan is to travel down on Friday 11th September with ride-outs on Sat and Sun for those that are interested. Dave Thornton has offered to lead a group down on Friday and back on Monday 14th. If you don’t fancy being in a group folks are free to make their own plans. Lots to see and do in the town and surrounding area, on or off the bike.
 
There are a limited number of rooms available: 6 doubles and 2 twins at £75 per night per room. There is one single available on Sat & Sun only. Breakfast is £5.50 extra in the hotel but there are lots alternative options in the town. 
 
We would be the only folk staying at the hotel so would also have exclusive use of the car park and a function room in the hotel. Rooms are basic but all have en-suite facilities. The owners are excited to have a hotel full of Geordies!

There is a £30 deposit required for each room booking. Payments to Colin Irvine (Treasurer) by BACS OR cheque. Cheques should be made payable to Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists and given to Colin. Please add your name as a reference.
