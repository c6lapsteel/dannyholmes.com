Given the restrictions introduced across north-east England from 18th September 2020, the Chief Observer and Training Team have decided, with regret, that **all observed rides are suspended with immediate effect and until further notice**.

In addition to the duty of care that we have for our Observers and Associates, we have to be aware of public perception at this difficult time.
