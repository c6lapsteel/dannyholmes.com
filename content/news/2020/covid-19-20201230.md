The Training Team have continued to keep restrictions under review. In addition to the duty of care that we have for our Observers and Associates, we have to be aware of public perception at this difficult time.

In accordance with latest IAM RoadSmart advice, observed rides are subject to national lockdowns and [local COVID-19 alert levels](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/full-list-of-local-covid-alert-levels-by-area "Go to GOV.UK list of COVID alert levels by area") as follows:

- TIER 1: MEDIUM
-- Observed rides may continue **with the agreement of Observers and Associates** 

- TIER 2: HIGH
-- Observed rides may continue **with the agreement of Observers and Associates** 

- TIER 3: VERY HIGH
-- Observed rides are **prohibited** 

- TIER 4: STAY AT HOME
-- Observed rides are **prohibited** 

- NATIONAL LOCKDOWN
-- Observed rides are **prohibited** 


If Observer and Associate are located in regions with different COVID alert levels, the highest alert level will determine whether assessment rides may take place.
 
To avoid unnecessary contact times briefing by email, telephone or video conference should be considered. The ride debrief may have to take the form of an email run-sheet supported by a telephone call as required.

Observed rides **MUST NOT** go ahead if either Associate or Observer:
- have tested positive for COVID-19 and should be self-isolating  
- are showing symptoms of COVID-19 and should be self-isolating  
- have been advised to shield or shelter as part of a vulnerable group or caregiver for a vulnerable person  
- are part of a household where residents are any of the above
