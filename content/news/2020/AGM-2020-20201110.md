Thank you to everyone who attended our 18th Annual General Meeting, elected the new Committee and raised questions and concerns.

The [Meet our team](/about/team/ "Go to the Meet our team page") has been updated. Please feel free to get in touch with any of the new Committee if you have concerns, questions or feedback.

## Members Survey
