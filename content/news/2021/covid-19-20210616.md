The Committee continues to review NAM's ctivities in the light of

- the [UK Government's roadmap](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021/covid-19-response-spring-2021-summary "Go to UK Government website") to easing covid restrictions
- [guidance from IAM Roadsmart](https://www.iamroadsmart.com/covid-19 "Go to IAM Roadsmart website")
- the need to resume observing and delivery of IAM Roadsmart courses as soon as possible
- members' desire to resume social activities such as monthly meetings and rideouts
- NAM's place in society locally and the need to maintain public support

Following the announcement from the UK Government this week and the delay to full lifting of restrictions, our plans are revised as follows:

### Bike Skills
Our bike skills session (originally scheduled for 27th June) will be postponed. This will take place as soon as possible once full restrictions have been lifted.

### Ride Out
Our first ride out, to be led by Dave Glennie, will be postponed by one week until **July 25th**.

### Grand Re-opening
We remain determined to celebrate the 're-opening' of NAM in style, with a large outdoor event. After discussions with the owner of the Drift Caf√©, we have agreed to postpone our celebration evening until **August 10th**.
