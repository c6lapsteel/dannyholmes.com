After more than five years in their respective roles as Chief Observer and Training Team Leaders, Jack Stewart, Michael Wilkinson and Graham Mundy are stepping down from the training team. 

We are grateful to them for their dedication and professionalism and for ensuring that NAM has continued to meet its charitable objective to the highest standards. Michael and Graham will continue as Observers.

We are delighted that Brian Douds has accepted our invitation to become Chief Observer ad interim until the next AGM when he will formally stand for election.

Jeff Glen, Keith Miller and Martin Trainor have accepted roles as Training Team Leaders. 

The training team will now comprise:

- Brian Douds (Chief Observer)
- Jeff Glen
- Keith Miller
- David Steedman
- Michael Sutherland
- Martin Trainor

We wish Brian, Jeff and Martin every success in their new roles and know that everyone will give them their full support.
