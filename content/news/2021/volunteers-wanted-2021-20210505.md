Going into the next year (from November 2021) there will be some movement in the members presently filling the NAM committee positions.  Some folk are stepping down, some have indicated they wish to change roles and some are planning to remain in-post. 

We are seeking volunteers from the membership to fill any of the [Committee and Team roles](/about/team/ "Go to our team page").  Once we understand how many volunteers we have and for which roles we can then formulate a robust succession plan to take NAM into the future.

If you feel you may be interested in volunteering for one of the above roles, or you would like to know more about these roles, then please email {{< update-el ep1="chair" ep2="namrider" ep3="com" >}} or join us on the 11th May at the monthly members Zoom meeting where we will discuss this along with other NAM updates as we emerge from lockdown. 

The [full announcement](https://pitstop.namrider.com/t/volunteers-wanted/144 "Go to the pitstop forum") is available to read on our pitstop forum and will be sent to all members by email along with Zoom meeting details. 

(To request forum access, please email {{< update-el ep1="info" ep2="namrider" ep3="com" >}}.)
