We wish all our members and Associates a safe, happy and healthy 2021. Thank you for your patience and for continuing to support NAM as we have had to adjust to a world post-COVID and find different ways of doing things. We sincerely hope that 2021 will allow us to meet and ride together again.

A [provisional list of meetings and events](/events/ "Go to the Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists events listing page") is now available. We will do whatever we can to ensure that events will go ahead on the dates planned, albeit that format and/or venue may have to change in response to COVID-19 restrictions.
