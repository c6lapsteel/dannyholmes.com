We are sorry to announce that Ron Patrick has decided to step down from his position as President of Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists with immediate effect.

Ron will continue to be a well loved and respected member of NAM and plans to join us at our social events over the summer. As many members will testify, Ron has contributed so much to the club throughout its history. We continue to be grateful for his passion for motorcycling, his inspiration, positive outlook and great sense of humour.

For further information, or if you would like to send a message of thanks to Ron, please email {{< update-el ep1="vice-chair" ep2="namrider" ep3="com" >}}.
