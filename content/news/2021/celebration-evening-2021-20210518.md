At long last COVID-19 restrictions are lifting, coffee shops are opening their doors and it is looking hopeful that we will be able to meet indoors again soon.

Throughout the pandemic our Training Team and Observers have taken advantage of every lockdown ‘window’ to keep working with our Associates. We are extremely to them grateful for their determination and professionalism.

For more than a year there has been little activity for established members of the club. The camaraderie and spirit of our monthly meetings and group rides has been sadly missing.

It is testament to the good will and patience of all our members that there are over 200 people who renewed their membership subscriptions, nonetheless.

We would like to take the earliest opportunity to bring our membership back together, to celebrate better times ahead and to thank you all for your patience and for continuing to be part of IAM and NAM.

On behalf of the Committee, I hope that members will be able to **join us for a Celebration and Thank You Evening at the Drift Café, Cresswell on July 13th 2021**. Free food (provisionally pizza and burgers) will be on offer courtesy of our Treasurer!

The Drift Café has indoor seating and a large covered outdoor area. We are still finalising details and will provide updates, including start time, over the coming weeks. This will be a ride-in and will replace the previously scheduled ‘Chip Shop Run’.

To help with catering, we may need to email out an invitation with a request to RSVP. We will provide a further update before these are sent out. For now, please put the date in your diary!
