In 2019 we had a couple of nights away camping in the Yorkshire Dales. We are thinking of organising similar weekend this year. 

Format as last time: 

- Friday: ride to campsite, set up, off to local pub for food and drink
- Saturday: ride out in local area, back to campsite, off to local pub for food and drink
- Sunday: ride home

Of course, any die-hard campers are more than welcome to cook their own food, etc.

This post is to gauge interest. If you are interested in taking part in a camping weekend, please send an email to {{< update-el ep1="secretary" ep2="namrider" ep3="com" >}}.
