Dear Members

Following the successful appointment of Brian Douds into the Chief Observer role the next priority is to fill the position of Secretary.  This is one of the 3 key officer posts without which we cannot operate as a club.

The secretary post is a key post in the committee dealing with correspondence from the NAM Committee but not memberships.  The membership elements are handled by our membership secretary Mary Holmes.  Splitting the post in two was a deliberate decision by NAM to maintain efficiency, have a focus for membership matters and at the same time further lessen the admin burden to committee volunteers.

I am really proud of the NAM committee as it is run in an informal style but is really efficient and functions entirely as it should, as a collective.  However, I would like to think that amongst the membership is someone who could volunteer take up the secretary role for NAM as we need a bit of help. 

If you think you can indeed help the club by taking on this role please email me {{< update-el ep1="chair" ep2="namrider" ep3="com" >}} by the end of June.
