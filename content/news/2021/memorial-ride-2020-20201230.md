Several proposals for lasting tributes have been made to Michael Sutherland (representing David's family) by the Committee. With their approval, David's contribution and leadership of NAM will be marked with the following tributes:

## Memorial Ride

A David Henderson and Jack Lormor memorial ride will take place, provisionally 5th September. A route will be arranged to take in locations and landmarks that were important to our former chairman. 

The ride will start with a formal donation to the Great North Air Ambulance by a member of the Committee on behalf of NAM.

Please check our [events](/events/ "Go to the Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists events listing") for confirmation of details.

## Tribute Page

Michael Sutherland and Danny Holmes will lead a project to create a permanent tribute page on our website. This will take time to research and compile, especially as face-to-face meetings are prohibited by COVID-19 restrictions. 

If you would like to take part in the project or have anecdotes or photographs that you would like to contribute, please email {{< update-el ep1="info" ep2="namrider" ep3="com" >}}.
