As we head into a new riding season we all need to get back into the 'zone' and sharpen our skills. The Training Team are preparing a series of interactive, Zoom workshops covering a range of subjects including:

- observation, anticipation, planning
- hazard awareness
- pillion riding
- overtaking
- many more

These will be added to our [events page](/events/ "Go to the Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists events listing page") soon! Meeting invites will be sent out by email over the next few weeks.

Make sure that you know [how to install and set-up Zoom](/posts/how-to-join-a-virtual-meeting/ "Read our introduction to Zoom article") and are ready to join in!
