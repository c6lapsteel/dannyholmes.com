We are sorry to report that the Fire Station Social Club is to close.

Our September meeting will be at a temporary venue until we can find a new home. Please check our Events page for venue updates.

If anyone has a suggestion for a suitable venue, where the costs aren't too high, please send a message to social@namrider.com.

We would like to express our gratitude to the Fire Service and to Jan and the team at the West Denton Social Club for their fantastic support and for making us feel at home.
