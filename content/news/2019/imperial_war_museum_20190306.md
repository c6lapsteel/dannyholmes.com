The Social Team are organising a trip to the Air Museum at Duxford on Saturday 2nd November 2019.

Ten double-rooms have been booked at the Holiday Inn Express, Duxford, Cambridge for 2 nights Friday 1st & Saturday 2nd November 2019.

Price is £85 per room per night including a full breakfast on Saturday & Sunday. Car parking is an additional £5 per vehicle (bike or car) for 24 hours. There is a pub, the Red Lion, across the road.

The deposit has been covered; those attending will be responsible for paying their own bill at the end of their stay.

Depending on interest, the team will look at booking a minibus to take members to the museum so that leave cars and bikes may be left at the hotel. Cost of entry to the museum will be confirmed, once the team have looked into the possiblity of a group concession.

There may be the possibility of a group ride down to Duxford on Friday.

This event is strictly 'first come, first served'. Please register your interest with a member of the Social Team at the next club night or send a message to {{< update-el ep1="social" ep2="namrider" ep3="com" >}}.

Should be a ‘grand day out Grommit’!
