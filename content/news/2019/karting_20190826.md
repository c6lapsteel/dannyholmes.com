The Social Team are planning to book another Karting evening on Thursday 28th November 2019 at 7pm.

The cost is £27 per person for 2 x 15 minute laps of the track, including safety equipment and briefing. Helmets and balaclavas are provided but you may wear your own.

Only 12 karts are allowed on the track at a time. Based on the number who registered interest, we will probably be split into 3 teams.

To confirm our booking, the Social Team need to know who will be attending and a payment of £27 per person.
