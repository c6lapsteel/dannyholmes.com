<p class='lead'>We’re in a small club in Newcastle ... upon Tyne that is. The town’s illustrious musical past weighs heavily on the shoulders of anyone who picks up a guitar around here. Who would wish to compete with the likes of Hank Marvin and Mark Knopfler in the twang territory or Sting in the songwriting stakes in the hearts of Newcastle folk?</p>

Diesel Therapy that’s who! But, as these pretenders are rattling through their soundcheck something sounds, ahem, amiss. Bass and drums are locked together but guitars appear to be playing two different tunes. Disaster? Well no, actually. Jim Hornsby (telecaster, dobro, veteran of much that has happened musically in the town) and Danny Holmes (telecaster, baritone guitar, veteran of nothing) glance at each other and crack up laughing. Music may be a serious business tonight, but such is their musical dexterity and almost telepathically guided playing that they quickly adjust and musical absurdity becomes one of their self-penned instrumental country/folk tinged workouts. And very good it is too!
