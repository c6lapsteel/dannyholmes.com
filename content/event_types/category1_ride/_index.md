Category 1 rides are aimed at riders who are still undergoing IAM Roadsmart training and who may be new to group riding. Observers will be more than happy to offer support and feedback.

Rides are typically 100-150 miles with several refreshment stops. They provide an opportunity for members to get used to the Drop-Off System.
