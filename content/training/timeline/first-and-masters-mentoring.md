Our Training Team have members who have achieved IAM Masters and ROSPA Gold, each referred to as the highest standards of civilian motorbike tests. We will mentor and advise any club member wanting to work towards this level of riding.

Speak to a member of the [Training Team]({{< ref "/about/team" >}} "Meet the NAM Training Team") for further information. You will be offered an opportunity to have an assessment of your skill level prior to making any commitment.
