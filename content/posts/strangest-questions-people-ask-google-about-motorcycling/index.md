Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists is run entirely by volunteers. Like everyone, our scarcest resource is time. We try to ensure that the articles we write, our workshops, the efforts of our training, social and marketing teams, are as useful or helpful to other motorcyclists as possible.

Finding out what concerns the biking community is key to ensuring that these efforts are relevant, as well as a great way to generate ideas for future articles.

## Search Questions
To that end (and, in truth, partly because I enjoy doing this sort of thing when the days are too cold and short to be out on my bike) I looked at the at the questions that have been entered into Google’s search box.

Using a keyword research tool, it is possible to extract details of past Google searches. In this case, I wanted to produce a list of every search worldwide containing a question word (who, how, what, why, when) combined with any of the words ‘motorcycle’, ‘motorbike’, etc.

I tidied the resulting data set to consolidate regional spelling variations (e.g. instances of ‘color’ were replaced with ‘colour’). This led to a list of 4522 unique search questions related to motorcycling.

For a bit of extra fun, and in order to visualize common themes amongst the questions, I created the following word cloud from the full list of questions. The word cloud itself was created using R (a statistical computing language), removing ‘stop words’ (a, the, it, on, etc.), the question words themselves and the motorcycle keywords (‘motorcycle’, ‘motorbike’, etc.).

The remaining words are scaled according to the frequency with which they appeared amongst the 4522 search questions. The resulting word cloud was exported to Adobe Illustrator and rearranged and recoloured to produce the following image.
