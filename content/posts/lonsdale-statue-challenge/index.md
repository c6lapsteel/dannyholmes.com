Ray Lonsdale is a steel fabricator from Durham, England, who has gained increasing acclaim and attention for his highly distinctive and thought-provoking sculptures ¹. Most of his work depicts the human form in some way or other, often in circumstances characterized by the industrial towns, villages, or fishing ports in which they’re found ⁵. His collections to date show the sculptor’s fascination with the human form. Built from steel, his work conveys incredible sensitivity and emotion, often providing deep moments of reflection ⁶.

Here is a summary of Ray Lonsdale's statues that you can visit:

1. **Tommy**: A 9 feet 5 inches tall statue of a First World War soldier, located close to Seaham war memorial, on Terrace Green by the seafront in Seaham, County Durham, in North East England. The corten steel statue weighs 1.2 tonnes and has a rusty red patina. It was commissioned by the Seaham Harbour Heritage Society and unveiled in 2014 ¹³.

2. **The Last Shift**: A sculpture commissioned by a committee which began at Wheatley Hill Mothers Club, for just over £25,000, and blessed by the Bishop of Jarrow when it was unveiled on 3rd May 2018 (exactly 50 years after the last shift at Wheatley Hill Colliery returned to the surface). It is located in Wheatley Hill, County Durham ⁵.

3. **The Coxswain**: A dramatic figure of a resolute lifeboat coxswain in 1950s-style life-jacket and oilskins steering an imaginary vessel to the rescue of mariners in distress. It was commissioned by East Durham Heritage Group and Lifeboat Centre for £24,000 and unveiled in November 2016. It is located in East Quay, Seaham Harbour Marina, County Durham ⁵.

4. **Not Much To Ask**: A 6 ft sculpture commissioned by Cornforth Parish Council on the centenary of World War One, it replaced a statue of Sicilian marble that had stood on the plinth – dedicated to 41 local men who failed to return from the conflict – since 1922. It is located in Mineworkers’Homes, Tursdale, County Durham ⁵.

5. **Freddie Gilroy and the Belsen Stragglers**: A statue made from weathering steel, depicting Freddie Gilroy, a former soldier who participated in the liberation of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, sitting on a bench in his old age. It is located in North Bay of Scarborough, England [^10^].

6. **The Smuggler's Apprentice**: A sculpture located on Merchant's Row, South Bay, Scarborough, England [^10^].

7. **A High Tide in Short Wellies**: A sculpture located in Filey, England [^10^].

8. **Pull Don't Push**: A sculpture located in Dalby Forest, England [^10^].

9. **Gan Canny**: A sculpture located in Gretna Green, Scotland ⁵.

10. **Fiddlers Green**: A sculpture located in Swadlincote, England ⁶.

Please note that some of these sculptures are inconspicuous and may require a bit of searching to locate them ⁵. The fabrication technique is distinctive and the sculptures easily accessible, but they’re often inconspicuous – particularly those that are merely life-size – turning the quests to locate them into something of a treasure-hunt ⁵. The ‘Corten’ weathering steel he uses develops an organic, rust-like patina which blends subtly with the environment ⁵.

The statues are located in different parts of England and Scotland, so it would take several days to visit them all. However, if you are driving, you can visit all the statues in approximately **3-4 days** .
