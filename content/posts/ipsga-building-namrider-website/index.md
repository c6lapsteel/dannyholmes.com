'The system' is a key part of an advanced rider's toolbox. It provides a systematic approach to dealing with each hazard that will be encountered on every journey. It enables the 'thinking rider' to create opportunities to make progress, without ever compromising the safety of any road user.

Even before setting out for his or her first observed ride, each prospective associate will, most likely, have initiated a number of smaller journeys. Some will start as a result of an on-line search for information: Is advanced riding right for me? What will I learn? What will it involve? How much will it cost? Others will be started to provide reassurance: Can I imagine being part of Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists? Will I fit in? How professional is the training? What support will I get? Will I be the only one? What will be expected of me?

In response to these information requests, small packets of information begin their separate journeys from our server to the prospective associate's computer or, more likely, mobile device. Like separate pieces of a jigsaw puzzle being couriered across a congested city by a fleet of motorcycle dispatch riders, each packet will navigate a different route through 'the web' before the puzzle is re-assembled by the viewer's browser. 

Even before the last piece of the puzzle reaches its destination, as our web page is still forming in front of the curious rider, first impressions are made. Rightly or wrongly, inferences are drawn between the online experience and the ability of the group to deliver first-class road safety training. Would you buy a brand new motorcycle from a dealer with broken signage and dirty floors?

Given that responsibility, what considerations need to be made when designing our shop-front? What would it look like if we applied 'the system' to building namrider.com?

## Information

This is a never-ending process: there are many 'hazards' that need to be re-evaluated through each of the subsequent phases. namrider.com continues to evolve based on testing and feedback. 

### Take

* what is the strategic direction provided by the Officers of the club?
    - should we have a website or use Facebook as our primary means of communication to members and prospective members?
    - how much budget is available? (Every penny spent on web hosting costs is money that can't be spent on rider training.)
    - what are the goals of the website? How will we measure if we have achieved them?
    - what are our priorities?
    - for which search terms should the site rank well?

* who are our visitors? How can we help them?
    - what do potential Associates need?
    - what do current Associates and Observers need?
    - how do they use social media?
    - what information and services do we need to provide for the membership of Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists?

* what functionality should the site have?
    - is it cost effective?
    - what is the total cost of ownership
    - how much work will be required to maintain that functionality?
    - does it contribute to our charitable aim of promoting motorcycle road safety?

* changes in technology
    - how will the way in which users interact with namrider.com will change?
    - what impact will voice search have? (Two-thirds of site visits are already from mobile devices.)
    - when should we use new techniques (e.g. http/2 protocol) for increased speed? How will that affect hosting costs?
    
* best practice and web standards
    - browser statistics
        - which 'make and model' do site visitors use? Which will we support?

* site audits
    - speed
        - how responsive is each page? 
        - where are the bottlenecks?
        - are there any errors or broken links?
    - search engine optimisation (SEO)
        - how does each page rank in searches?
        - is there anything that might be harming our ranking?
    - accessibility
        - how easily can individuals with colour-blindness or disabilities access namrider.com? 
    - how does namrider.com perform compared to peer and 'competitor' sites?

* rules and regulations
    - the need for a privacy policy
    - GDPR legislation
    - Guidance from IAM


<hr class="my-4">

### Use

* output of our 'customer journey' workshop 
    - this identified potential 'pain points' and frequently asked questions that should be answered as a potential Associate is deciding whether to commit to advanced rider training

* privacy preferences
    - not only must we acknowledge visitor's cookie settings, we have to act on them. Site functionality (like analytic tags) must be switched off when requested, even if that limits our ability to improve the site.

* diagnostics (analytics)
    - how can we quantify the value of namrider.com?
    - what can we learn about how visitors use namrider.com? 
    - which pages are contributing to our charitable aims?
    - which pages are not contributing to our charitable aims?
    - which pages have high 'bounce rates' and may need to be re-written?

* design inspiration
    - books
    - courses
    - vinyl album covers
    - blogs

<hr class="my-4">

### Give

* SSL certificate
    - like a motorcycle's V5c document, a site's SSL ('secure sockets layer') certificate confirms the identity of the domain (namrider.com) and owner
    - lets all visitors and search engines know that namrider.com is secure and all traffic to and from our server is encrypted
    - this is what makes the little padlock appear in your web browser

* accessibility
    - information (tags and metadata) to help those using screen-readers
    - choice of colour palette that will give strong contrast between different elements of the site
    - choice of typography (fonts) that are easy to read across all devices

* articles   

* signposts and site map
    - provide site maps, menus and links that will allow users and search engine robots to navigate through the site
    - on-page and off-page SEO
        - provide meta-data that will tell search engine which pages to index
        - provide meta-data that will allow search engines to understand the purpose of different page elements (e.g. addresses, events, etc.)
        - prevent robots from scanning and indexing certain pages

<hr class="my-4">

### Don't Give!

Okay, not really part of 'the system' but particularly important in this context!

* prevent personally identifiable information (PII) from being passed on to third-parties, including analytic applications
* obscure email references so that these can't be easily 'scraped'

<div class="jumbotron bg-white">


## Position

* site hierarchy
    - minimize the number of clicks (levels from the home page) that the visitor needs to make to find important content

* prioritisation of visual content for mobile devices
    - how should the priority and position of each component change on different screen sizes, orientations and resolutions?

* use of 'white space' 
    - ensure that pages can breathe and don't feel overwhelming  (a bit like cracking open the visor on a helmet as you're riding)

* typographic layout
    - maximise readability of text (through choice of font size, line length and line height)
        - eyes lose focus when having to read very long lines of text
        - it is tiring to have to keep skipping to the start of very short lines of text
    - ensure that articles can be scanned quickly

## Speed

As with advanced riding, progress matters! In order to retain the visitor's interest, pages need to be displayed as quickly as possible. [Studies have shown that](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/ "Read page speed benchmarks"), as page load times increase from 1 to 3 seconds, the probability that a user will give up and go elsewhere jumps by 32%. By 5 seconds, that bounce probability has risen by 90%.

Google, and other search engine vendors, also need to ensure that sites which appear in their listings perform well (and have good content). If they don't, and users have a poor experience using the search engine, advertising revenues will suffer. So if Google advise that slow sites may be disadvantaged in mobile search results, developers had better take note.

So our objective is to finish the top part of the page, that which initially fills the visitors screen, in under 1 second and on all devices. This is known as the time to 'first contentful paint'. In other words, we want to ensure that all the pieces of the puzzle which contain bits of sky arrive first and are put together before the parts which are off-screen (below the fold).

However, even before we can get off the starting grid, 600ms will already have elapsed:

- 20-120ms to look up the the network address of our namrider.com server. (This 'domain name server' or DNS lookup is the internet equivalent of trying to find someone in the yellow pages.)
- 50-100ms for each round trip of data between browser and server over a 4G network. That increases to 200-300ms over 3G.
- 200ms for the browser to collect and layout the pieces of the puzzle.

Practically, to achieve a load time of under 1 second, we have only ~400ms in which to transfer content. Like winning a superbike race, it takes a lot of preparation and effort to shave milliseconds off each lap time. 

### Wrong turns

* To make sure our motorcycle couriers get to where they need to be in the shortest time, we must eliminate (or minimise) address changes. Redirects are required if the address of a page (or even the entire site) is changed.

### Number of round trips

If you have too much luggage to fit in your panniers, more round trips are required to get all that stuff to where you're going. The same is true with web pages: only so much information can be fetched with each package request. The aim is to keep the number of request and transfer file sizes as small as possible. It is therefore important to:
* Minimise the number of requests required to deliver 'above the fold' content by removing anything that is unused or non-essential.
* Decide what to build and host locally (on namrider.com) rather than using third-party plug-ins hosted on different domains.
    - Each piece of externally hosted content will require additional DNS lookups.
    - Externally hosted files and functionality introduces potential points of failure: if the host server is slow or availability cannont be guaranteed, there is a chance that our page build will be delayed or blocked as we wait for a response.
* Reduce the size of every file that contributes to the page. Different file types tell the browser what should be on the page (the 'markup' language), what it should look like ('stylesheets') and how it should react to in response to user interactions ('scripts'). Files need to be:
    * combined where possible (to minimize the number of information requests that are needed). By ensuring each pannier is full, space is optimised and no unnecessary journeys are required.
    * 'minified' to remove whitespace, developer's comments or anything else that a computer doesn't care about. This is the equivalent of sawing handles off toothbrushes before packing them.

### Road blocks and level crossings
Each journey needs to be planned to avoid delays en route; temporary traffic lights or level crossings giving priority to other traffic. Care has to be given to ensure that scripts and stylesheets are loaded in the right sequence and that there are no 'render-blocking resources' getting in the way of loading above the fold content.

* All scripts need to be written to be as lean as possible, to execute quickly and in the right sequence. 
* Avoid any blocking script or stylesheets from external (third-party) plug-ins.
* Avoid creating chains where critical resources have to be loaded sequentially.

### Farkles

You probably wouldn't prepare a motorcycle to win a superbike championship by doubling its weight with aftermarket accessories from a Touratech catalog. Yet many web pages are bloated by widgets, images and videos which do not directly help the visitor achieve his or her objective. Not only are they distracting, they add to the cost of viewing and hosting the website.

* Every piece of content, whether a script delivering a fancy page animation, an unused font or an image of a front fork, needs to be assessed and removed if it is not essential

    - 10MB of unnecessary video content x 1000 page visits per month = 10,000MB chunk of bandwidth that needs to be paid for and which doesn't contribute to our charitable aims
    - every KB of unnecessary content will eat into our visitor's mobile data plan. They won't thank us for it.

### Images

Did you know that for every image displayed on namrider.com, at least eight different versions have been created? The actual image you see will depend on your browser and whether you are viewing on a desktop computer or mobile device.

Images quickly consume a lot of bandwidth. There are many important steps which can be used to very significantly reduce their payload and improve user experience:

#### Size

* Ensure that all images are sized properly. In addition to cropping out unnecessary parts of the image, separate versions need to be created for different screen sizes and resolutions (including retina displays). It is then necessary to detect what type of device a visitor is using and display the appropriate image. This ensures that a mobile user isn't being made to download a desktop-sized image.

#### Compression

* Optimally compress all images. Within motorsport and other industries, structural engineers have been known to [drill holes in structural components to make them lighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightening_holes "Read about lightening holes in Wikipedia"). This isn't done randomly but with careful calculation so as not to introduce stresses or otherwise compromise strength. In a similar way, mathematics can be used to selectively remove pixels from pictures to reduce file size but without noticeable degredation of image quality. How much compression to apply is often trial and error.

* Choose appropriate images. Image compression actually starts in the camera itself. Images with a narrow depth of field (the subject is sharp whilst the background and foreground are blurred) are much smaller than those with a large depth of field.

#### Format

* Deliver images in 'next-generation' formats (especially for Chrome users). Some browsers support image formats (Webp, JPEG 2000) which can be compressed to a smaller size, without noticable loss in quality. Again that means that images need to be created in each different format (as well as size) and the smallest possible image given to each visitor (depending on their browser and screen size).

#### Just-in-time

* Defer the loading of off-screen (below the fold) images until after all visible parts of the page have been displayed.

* In the 1980s, American motorcycle manufacturers like [Harley-Davidson were struggling to competete with Japanese competitors](https://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Operations/Harley-Davidson-JIT.htm "Find out more about Harley-Davidson's JIT journey"). Rather than using traditional approaches to continuously build and push out components regardless of demand, Japanese manufactures had developed 'just-in-time' (JIT) processes. By detecting how far down a page a user has scrolled, it is possible to delay the point at which an image is downloaded until just before it is needed. Until then a tiny (in terms of file size) placeholder is used as a substitute for the real image. This is known as 'lazy loading' of images.

#### Vector graphics

Simple graphics (like the icons used to highlight phone numbers and email addresses in the page footer below) can be described mathematically. By using their mathematical formula directly in the code of the page, rather than embedding a separate graphical image file, reliance on large, external icon font libraries can be avoided.

### Maintenance schedule

You wouldn't expect that every motorcycle part needs to be replaced at every service: engine oil may need to be replaced every 6000 miles, spark plugs every 12000 miles. Likewise, it is possible to specify a maintenance schedule or 'cache policy' for a web site. Images and logos do not change often and it is possible to indicate to the visitor's browser that they have a 1-year expiry date. The browser may then keep a copy of those files in its internal storage until the next visit. If it detects that the file date is less than the expiry date indicated by the server, it does not need to re-fetch the image.
