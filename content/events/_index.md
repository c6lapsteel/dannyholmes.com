To maintain NAM's reputation for well organised events and safe group riding, please ensure that you arrive in time for the safety briefing and with a full tank of petrol. Riders who miss the safety briefing may be excluded from the event!

Remember that you are responsible for your own safety and compliance with the law. Ride within your capabilities. Never follow a manoeuvre by riders in front without applying 'the system' to formulate your own riding plan.
