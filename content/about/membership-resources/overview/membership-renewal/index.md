Confused about IAM and NAM renewal processes? Read our [guide to understanding your IAM and NAM subscriptions and the difference between them](/posts/guide-to-iam-and-nam-subscriptions/ "Read our guide IAM and NAM subscriptions").

### Standing order

Paying your annual NAM subscription by Standing Order makes it easier to plan the finances for the club. Standing orders should be amended to Â£20. Please send the completed mandate to your bank.

### Cheque

You can still pay by cheque but this has to be made in the first two weeks of January. If paying by cheque please put your IAM membership number on the back.

If you want to update your personal details (such as phone number or e-mail address) you will need to [contact IAM]("https://www.iamroadsmart.com/contact" "Contact IAM Roadsmart") to let them know. In accordance with GDPR regulations and our [privacy policy](/about/policies/privacy-policy/ "Read our privacy policy"), we do not hold personal details of NAM members.

Thank you for your prompt payment!
