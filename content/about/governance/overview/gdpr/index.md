GDPR regulations require us to establish a legal basis for holding and processing personal details of members and Associates.

### Data Audit

A Data Audit Report was written in 2018 by Danny Holmes and a GDPR working group. This report summarises:

- How data flows into NAM
- How data is shared internally within NAM
- Who has access to it
- Who we share it with
- Whether we are transferring any data abroad

Please contact a Committee Member if you would like a copy of the report.
