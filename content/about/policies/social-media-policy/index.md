These policies are aimed at ensuring an open, inclusive and diverse membership.

## Facebook Groups
We support Facebook's guidance ['What names are allowed on Facebook'](https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576 "Go to Facebook support document").

To ensure that club members know who they are connecting to through the NAM Members and NAM Observers closed groups, access will only be granted to Facebook accounts which go by names that are used in everyday life. Profile names must be recognisable as IDs in NAM subscription payments or other group documents (e.g. training records).

Whilst the real life identity of some 'anonymous' profiles may be determined from photographs in some cases, we aim for a policy which fosters an open, friendly, accepting and supportive online experience consistent with our club values.
