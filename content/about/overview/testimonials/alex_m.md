I came to biking via the direct access route in August 2016 and was looking for further training to make me a better, safer rider. I came across the IAM website and liked what I read.

Joining was very easy along and I was soon made welcome at an evening meeting of my local group, Northumbria Advanced Motorcylists

My expectations have been well and truly surpassed. I had been concerned that, because I choose to ride a mid-capacity (650cc ) bike, I would be out of my depth. No such thing!

I was very quickly assigned to my Observer and we arranged a ride to enable him to assess my riding. We developed an action plan, then built on that over a series of rides which I thoroughly enjoyed. My Observer gradually took me through "the system", building foundation skills, leading to me passing my advanced test.

I can't believe the progress I've made in a relatively short period of time. Learning how to become an advanced rider is a course of action I would recommend to anyone who rides on public roads, irrespective of age, sex or ability.

It's great to sort problem(s) that have been bugging you, to ride with confidence and get more enjoyment from riding your bike.
