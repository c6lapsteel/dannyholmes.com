I came across NAM and IAM through an internet search. I was hoping to find a way to make my riding a bit smoother and to meet people who shared my love of biking.

The signing up process was quick and easy and I was assigned an Observer who was in touch within a few days. I was also put in touch with the Membership Secretary who introduced me to the NAM ladies. Everyone was lovely and, despite being worried that I would get lost on ride-outs, the drop-off system kept me with the group.

My Observer was crucial in the development of my understanding of ‘the system’ and helped transform my riding through a combination of observation, demonstration, diagrams, reading materials and many discussions over a cuppa. I also attended a slow riding session and picked up some great tips which have massively increased my confidence when filtering and manoeuvring at slow speeds.

I have just passed my test and am looking forward to finding new ways to improve my riding as part of NAM. I thought the advanced test was the end goal but it turns out, it’s just the beginning!
