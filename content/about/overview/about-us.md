Our aim is to help motorcyclists become 'thinking riders'. Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists' qualified, volunteer Observers prepare riders to pass their advanced rider test.

With over 200 club members of all ages, male and female, every type of bike is represented. Motorcyclists join NAM for many different reasons including:

* seeking confidence to ride in all environments
* looking to improve and test their skills
* seeking additional training
* obtaining objective feedback on current riding
* seeking more enjoyment from riding
* needing an advanced test to join Blood Bikes

Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists is affiliated to the Institute of Advanced Motorists and is a registered charity (1099238).
