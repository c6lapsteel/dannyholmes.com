Our aim is to help motorcyclists ride to the highest standards by providing on-going support and advice. Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists' qualified, volunteer Observers prepare riders to pass their Advanced and Masters road tests.

With over 200 club members of all ages, male and female, every type of bike is represented. Motorcyclists join NAM for many different reasons. These include:

* seeking further development after passing the DSA test
* looking for safer and more enjoyable riding
* looking for other bikers to ride with
* wanting to join Blood Bikes and needing an advanced riding qualification
* fear of leaning and braking on bends
* fear of riding on busy roads and filtering
* fear of riding in the wet
* fear of getting back on the bike after an 'off'

Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists is affiliated to the Institute of Advanced Motorists and is a registered charity (1099238).
