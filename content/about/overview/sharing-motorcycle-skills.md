We encourage members and pillions to support one another and to share riding experiences. Our programme of rideouts and weekend breaks give riders the opportunity for continuous improvement and to exchange 'know how'.

* group rides
* 'chip shop runs'
* group weekend breaks
* theory sessions
* machine control skills days
* touring workshop
* winter riding workshop
* 'two-up' riding workshop
* slow riding practice
* non-riding, social activities

This is also your chance to meet new riding buddies. Whether you prefer touring, off-road riding or track days, come and join us!
