We encourage members to support one another and to share riding experiences. Our programme of workshops, rideouts and weekend breaks give riders the opportunity for continuous improvement and to exchange 'know how':

* senior rides (full members only)
* associate rides (all members)
* 'chip shop runs' and summer evening rides
* group weekend breaks
* theory sessions
* machine control skills days
* touring workshop
* winter riding workshop
* 'two-up' riding workshop
* slow riding practice
