To pass your IAM Roadsmart test, you will need to make safe progress on all types of roads, including motorways and dual carriageways. The Highway Code prohibits riders of motorcycles under 50 cc from riding on motorways. In practice, you will need a road-legal motorcycle with an engine capacity above 250 cc. Members have passed their tests on cruisers, sports bikes, adventure bikes, tourers and scooters.
