The Training Administrator will allocate you to an Observer who will accompany you on your journey to becoming an Advanced Rider. Training takes the form of one-to-one, observed rides. Your Observer will accompany you on several rides so that he or she can give you pointers and advice, building up your skills until you are ready to put yourself forward for the IAM Roadsmart test.

Your Observer will usually talk over an aspect of your IAM Roadsmart course handbook and will select routes which provide opportunities to practice the skills discussed. You will be invited to classroom sessions and bike skills sessions. You will also be able to join other members on our monthly, 'Category 1' ride-outs. These is an ideal opportunity to meet other members and to discuss aspects of advanced road riding.
