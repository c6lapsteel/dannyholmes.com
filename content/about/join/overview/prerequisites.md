To join Northumbria Advanced Motorycyclists, you must:

- hold a full motorcycle licence
- book an Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) Roadsmart Course (£149*) or be a full IAM member.

The IAM Roadsmart package includes course material, test fee and first year memberships of both IAM and Northumbria Advanced Motorcyclists.

Once enrolled, you will be allocated to a local Observer. Your Observer will provide 1:1 coaching until you are ready to take your Advanced road test. As your Observer is a volunteer, you are asked to contribute £15 per session towards fuel and 'wear and tear'.

We offer free, no-obligation 'taster' rides. Contact us to book your assessment or join us at one of our monthly meetings to discuss further.
