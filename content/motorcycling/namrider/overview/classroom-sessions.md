In addition to 'on the road' advanced motorcycle training, every season the Training Team deliver classroom-based theory sessions. These focus on specific skills in line with the IAM Roadsmart Associates Handbook. The sessions explain the theory behind advanced riding and provide opportunities for discussion and sharing of experiences which can be particularly valuable.

Workshops cover:

- cornering
- overtaking
- motorways and dual carriageways
- human factors
- winter riding
- carrying a pillion
- continental touring
- shipping your bike abroad
- the use of sat-navs and route plotting software
- packing for a trip

For details of forthcoming sessions, see our [motorcycle training events](https://namrider.com/event_types/training/ "Go to our motorcycle training events page") page.

Our club members have a vast amount of experience of all kinds of riding on all types of bikes, in all manner of places and conditions. Learn from their mistakes, pick their brains and even join them on trips exclusively for those new to motorbike touring!
