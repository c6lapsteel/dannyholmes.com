## Route Description

This is a rewarding, full-day Northumberland loop built for experienced riders who enjoy technical variety and long, flowing miles. Expect a mix of narrow, challenging single-track lanes, sweeping A-roads, and fast, open sections that showcase everything from moorland and forest to rugged coastline. With light traffic, big horizons, and plenty of corners to link together, it’s a route that rewards precision, pace, and smooth group riding from start to finish.

This Northumberland loop is best ridden clockwise to keep the sun behind you for a long as possible — perfect for lighting that brings out the best of the landscape (especially in Autumn).

## Look Out For

The landscape tells the story of survival in lawless borderlands. This was one of the most contested borders in Europe. Almost every settlement has fortifications, and the thick-walled churches served as refuges during raids. Many villages have bastle houses - unique fortified farmhouses with living quarters above and livestock below.

### Bolam Lake Country Park

Bolam Lake Country Park was created beginning in 1816 by the notable architect John Dobson for Reverend John Beresford (later Lord Decies), the local landowner, as a project to provide work during economic decline. The lake was formed by transforming a swampy area known as Bolam Bog into a picturesque artificial lake with woodlands and islands. The project took three years to complete.

### Whalton

The only village in Northumberland to continuously maintain the ancient midsummer "bale fire" since 1903, held every July 4th (Old Midsummer's Eve according to the pre-1752 calendar).

The word "bale" originated in Northumberland to describe beacon fires lit to warn of Border raiders.

### Elsdon

Once the capital of Redesdale and the largest settlement in Northumberland National Park.

In 1584, Border Reivers killed 14 men, took 400 prisoners, and stole 400 horses and 400 cattle in a single, brutal raid.

Elsdon boasts the best preserved motte and bailey castle site in Northumberland, built by Robert de Umfraville after 1066. Elsdon Tower is a rare vicar's pele (fortified tower) dating from 1400 with 9-foot-thick walls.

### Bamburgh

Originally called Din Guarie, Bamburgh may have been the capital of the Celtic kingdom of Bernicia from c.420-547 AD. It is named after Queen Bebba, wife of King Æthelfrith (c.600 AD) - "Bebbanburgh".

Bamburgh was the first English castle to fall to cannon fire in 1464 during the Wars of the Roses.
