## Route Description

Not the longest ride, but far enough if the weather is poor. Care should be taken on the first leg as farm vehicles are on the move and there was a lot of pheasants on the verges.
After Hexham the roads are good with great views. Care needs to be taken on the Cobblestones in Alston.

Seaton Burn - Ponteland- Stanfordham - Wentworth Café car park, Hexham.

Hexham - Haydon Bridge - Alston - Middleton-in-Tessdale - Staindrop to Sam Turner's garden centre at Piercebridge for lunch.

On to the A68 north to Fir Tree (petrol at the Jet Garage), then along the A689 through Wolsingham, Stanhope, St. Johns Chapel and on
through Allendale returning to Hexham. 

Through Hexham main street to Riding Mill, joining the A68 for a couple of miles ending at Brockbushes farm shop. **(160 miles.)**
