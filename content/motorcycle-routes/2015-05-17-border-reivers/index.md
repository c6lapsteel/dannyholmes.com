A ride up past Kielder Water into the Scottish Boarders where we will do some cattle rustling, pillage and tea drinking before heading for the coast and back home via Alnwick.

Although this ride is not particularly high mileage, some of the roads in the Borders are rough and narrow so progress will be slow on the Bonchester Bridge to Wooler section.
