## Look Out For

### Humshaugh

The village of Humshaugh is cited as the location of the first official Scout Camp from 22nd August to 4th September 1908. The precise location of the camp, marked by a cairn, is actually a few miles to the west at Carr Edge. Thirty-six boys arrived at Fourstones station to be marched the mile to the campsite for a week in the rain.

In the eighteenth century the local paper mill produced counterfeit French money. This was to be used to destabilise the French economy during the Revolutionary Wars.
