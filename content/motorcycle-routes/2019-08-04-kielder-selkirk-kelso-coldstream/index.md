## Look Out For

### B6318 - The Military Road

Field Marshal George Wade is the only person mentioned by name in the British National Anthem. The sixth verse was added as a prayer for Wade's army, assembled in Newcastle in 1745, to successfully suppress the Scottish Jacobite Uprising.

However, the poor quality of the road network at the time severely hampered Wade's efforts. It took his troops a full week to march the 60 miles from Newcastle to Carlisle. This slow progress allowed the Jacobite forces, led by Charles Edward Stuart (better known as "Bonnie Prince Charlie"), to outmaneuver Wade's army. The Jacobites were able to capture Carlisle, Lancaster, Preston, and Manchester in rapid succession.

This military setback highlighted the urgent need for improved road communications to support troop movements, becoming a priority for the Hanoverian government. Construction of a military road alongside Hadrian's Wall began, which was completed in 1758. Unfortunately, this infrastructure came at a significant cost to Britain's ancient heritage. Much of Hadrian's Wall was destroyed in the process, as its stones were used as hardcore for the new military road.

### Village Green, Denholm

Denholm underwent a complete reconstruction in the 17th century after its destruction by English raiders. The rebuilding effort adopted an orderly layout centered around an English-style village green, marking a significant shift in character. By 1844, the village had become a thriving center of textile production. Eighty-seven knitting frames, operated in the cottages of Denholm, produced stockings in such quantities that the profits funded the renovation of many of village's dwellings.
