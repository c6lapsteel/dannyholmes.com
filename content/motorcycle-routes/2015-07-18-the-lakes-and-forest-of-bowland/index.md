## Route Description

A two-day trip to the Lake District avoiding the main tourist hot-spots and exploring the western and southern parts of this beautiful National Park. A few miles to the east, on the other side of the M6 motorway, is the Trough of Bowland: an ‘Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty’ popular with bikers of all types.

Then down the side of Ullswater stopping for lunch at Booths supermarket in Keswick (lovely cafe and fantastic deli counter). After lunch head deeper into the Lakes past Derwent Water and over the Honister Pass alongside Buttermere and Crummock Water. Then join the A5086 around the back of the Lake District National Park, eventually stopping for coffee at the [Bluebird Café](http://www.thebluebirdcafe.co.uk "Go to the Bluebird Café website") on the shore of Coniston Lake. From there join the A590 at Newby Bridge, crossing the M6 to pick up the A65 to Kirkby Lonsdale. A quick coffee stop at Devil's Bridge before heading west down the Lune Valley to an overnight stay in Lancaster.

Head back to Caton then turn right off the A683 to Quernmore and cross the western part of the Forest of Bowland, stopping for coffee at [Little Town Dairy](http://www.littletowndairy.co.uk/ "Go to Little Town Dairy website") near Longridge. After leaving the café head off back into the Forest of Bowland stopping at the famous view point of Jeffrey Hill. On then via Slaidburn to a lunch stop in Settle before heading home via the Ribble Head viaduct and Kirkby Stephen. Then onto the A66 east to Barnard Castle and across to the A68 in West Auckland.
