### Belsay

Belsay features the exceptional Belsay Hall, Castle and Gardens, with a 14th-century medieval tower house.
The Grecian-inspired Belsay Hall (built 1810-1817) was created by Sir Charles Monck after his honeymoon in Athens. The unique Quarry Garden was carved from the stone used to build the hall.

### Stamfordham

Stamfordham has one of the largest village greens in Northumberland. St. Mary's Church contains Saxon elements dating to the 7th century. The Bay Horse Inn is a former coaching inn and dates back to the 18th century.

### Matfen

Matfen Hall was the seat of the Blackett family, wealthy lead-mining industrialists. The parish church was built by Sir Edward Blackett in 1842. The village features an historic pele tower dating from border reiving days.

### Capheaton

Capheaton Hall, built in 1668, is one of the earliest Baroque country houses in England. The Swinburne family owned the estate from the 13th century until 2008. In 1747, one of England's first porcelain factories was established in Capheaton.

### Wark

Wark Castle was a key border fortress during the Anglo-Scottish wars and changed hands between English and Scottish control several times. King John of England stayed at Wark Castle in 1213. The village suffered significantly during border raids throughout medieval times.
