## Route Description

A ride featuring the valleys of the Tyne, Tees and Wear. The route is similar to the [Three Rivers Ride](/motorcycle-routes/2015-10-18-three-rivers/ "Go to Three Rivers Ride") of 2015 but this time it’s in the opposite direction with a few changes.

### Tyne Valley

From Seaton Burn the ride goes via Berwick Hill, Ponteland, Stamfordham Road and crosses the Military Road to pass through Wylam. Cross Wylam Bridge, Sled Lane, into Crawcrook. Turn right at the traffic lights and onto A695 heading west through Mickley, Stocksfield, Riding Mill to Hexham.

In the centre of Hexham pass the hospital (on the left) and the former cattle mart. At the Tap and Spile pub take a sharp left turn uphill onto the B6306 followed by a right fork (signposted Whitley Chapel and Racecourse Caravan Site) and onto Dipton Mill Road. Turn right onto Causey Hill Road (signposted Allendale and Hexham Racecourse) and past Hexham Racecourse. Fantastic views to the right along this road!
Take the B6305 and B6304 before joining the B6295 through Catton, Allendale, Sinderhope, Sparty Lea and into Allenheads and coffee stop at [Hemmel Café, Allenheads](http://thehemmelcafe.co.uk/index.htm "Go to the Hemmel Café website"). **(46 miles.)**


### Wear Valley

Continue on the A68 then take B6275 which leads to the lunch stop at [Sam Turner’s Garden Centre](https://www.sam-turner.co.uk "Go to Sam Turner's website") just outside Piercebridge. **(84 miles)**

## Tees Valley
Leave Sam turner’s on the B6275 before turning onto B6279 towards Staindrop. Continue on B6269 to Eggleston then B6282 through Middleton-in-Teasdale. The road becomes the B6277 through Langdon Beck to Alston. (Caution on the cobbled main street of Alston.) Left turn at the bottom of the hill to fuel stop at the Texaco Garage (good parking and toilets are available). **(125 miles)**

From Alston take the A686, Whitfield, Langley to the junction with the A69. Turning east to the end of the ride at [Brockbushes Farm Shop](https://www.brocksbushes.co.uk "Go to Brockbushes website"). **(160 miles)**
