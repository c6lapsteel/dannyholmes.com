This ride has everything from open moorland and narrow, technical Pennine descents to classic sweeping roads skirting the Yorkshire Dales and across the North Yorks Moors.

## Route Description

Through Ponteland to Corbridge, then via Blanchland to the Durham Dales Centre in Stanhope for coffee. **(45 miles)**.

A689 to St. Johns Chapel then left on to Harthorpe Road to the B6277 through to Middeleton in Teesdale and onto Barnard Castle. Taking care crossing the A66, left onto Stanglane and across into Reeth for Lunch.

Reeth across Whipperdale Bank to Leyburn (petrol stop). **(97 miles.)**

South on the A6108 through Masham to the B6267, feed onto the A61 for Thirsk.

Thirsk pick up the A170 to Helmsley (petrol stop) **(137 miles.)**

Helmsley to Stokelsy on the B1257, via the B1365 to the A174 heading for the A19 Northbound services. (Ride finishes here.)

## Look Out For

In Barnard Castle, take a short detour past Bowes Museum. Turn right immediately after the museum to cross the river. Ride down the small lane past the ruins of Egglestone Abbey before rejoining the B6277.

After the hairpin and steep ascent of Sutton Bank (A170), take time to stop at the National Park Centre and follow the footpath a short distance to the 'best view in England'.
